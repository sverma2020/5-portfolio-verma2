									<h2>After High School</h2>
									<p>My major will be in neurology/biology in college. After this, is will go into the medical field. Since my favorite subjects in school are math and science, I decided to combine the two by majoring in neurlogy/biology. By the time I complete my undergrad and grad as well as medical school, technology will advance a lot. There is a high percent of the concept of Artificial Intelligence being the key to many technological advances in a few years due to computer engineering. So the medical field will be affected a lot when performing surgeries, and medicine.</p>
