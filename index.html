									<p>I have done karate since I was six years old. The style of karate I do is Okinawan Shuri Ru. I wanted to try how it is like and I really enjoyed it from the moment I started. I had really good mentors and teachers who helped me through the harships in my life. I have been continuing whenever I get time to. I have moved a lot since seventh grade but I know that I will continue on. </p>

									<p>I have done piano since I was in 8th grade. I was in Allegro Music in California. Piano gives me relaxation when I have a hard day. My piano teacher helped me a lot and made the class fun. I performed in the spring recital last year and the summer recital last year as well. It was very fun. My goal is to try to compose a song and play it live.</p>

									<p>I have done bollywood dance from January of last year until June of last year. It was really  fun. I love to dance so it felt so nice to be in a professional dance group. The dance company that I was in was Riar Academy in California. I will definetly continue dance and try other styles of dances like salasa, jazz, waltz, tango. I also am in the dance club in my school. We perform at pep rally's, the talent shows, and in an in school assembly. I will continue this as well. I love the choreographies that our team in dance club makes. It is not hard and not a lot of pressure to remember. It is very fun and flexible.</p>
